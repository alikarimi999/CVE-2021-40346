/* the macros below define an optional type for each of the 4 args passed to
 * the trace() call. When such a type is set, the caller commits to exclusively
 * using a valid pointer when this argument is not null. This allows the trace()
 * function to automatically start or stop the lock-on mechanism when it detects
 * a type that it can dereference such as a connection or a stream. Each value
 * is represented as an exclusive bit and each arg is represented by a distinct
 * byte. The reason for using a single bit per value is to speed up tests using
 * bitmasks. Users must not declare args with multiple bits set for the same arg.
 * By default arguments are private, corresponding to value 0.
