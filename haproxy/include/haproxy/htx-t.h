/*
 * The internal representation of an HTTP message, called HTX, is a structure
 * with useful information on the message followed by a contiguous array
 * containing parts of the message, called blocks. A block is composed of
 * metadata (htx_blk) and the associated payload. Blocks' metadata are stored
 * starting from the end of the array while their payload are stored at the
 * beginning. Blocks' metadata are often simply called blocks. it is a misuse of
 * language that's simplify explanations.
 *
 *
 *  +-----+---------------+------------------------------+--------------+
 *  | HTX |  PAYLOADS ==> |                              | <== HTX_BLKs |
 *  +-----+---------------+------------------------------+--------------+
 *        ^
 *        blocks[] (the beginning of the bocks array)
 *
 *
 * The blocks part remains linear and sorted. You may think about it as an array
 * with negative indexes. But, instead of using negative indexes, we use
 * positive positions to identify a block. This position is then converted to a
 * address relatively to the beginning of the blocks array.
 *
 *
 *      .....--+------------------------------+-----+-----+
 *             |                       ...    | BLK | BLK |
 *      .....--+------------------------------+-----+-----+
 *                                            ^     ^
 *                            Addr of the block     Addr of the block
 *                            at the position 1     at the position 0
 *
 *
 * The payloads part is a raw space that may wrap. You never access to a block's
 * payload directly. Instead you get a block to retrieve the address of its
 * payload. When no more space left between blocks and payloads parts, the free
 * space at the beginning, if any, is used.
 *
 *
 *        +----------- WRAPPING ------------------------+
 *        |                                             |
 *        V                                             |
 *  +-----+-------------+---------------+---------------++--------------+
 *  | HTX | PAYLOAD ==> |               |  PAYLOADS ==X || X== HTX_BLKs |
 *  +-----+-------------+---------------+---------------++--------------+
 *
 *
 * The blocks part, on its side, never wrap. If we have no space to allocate a
 * new block and if there is a hole at the beginning of the blocks part (so at
 * the end of the blocks array), we move back all blocks.x
 *
 *
 *    ...+--------------+----------+   blocks  ...+----------+--------------+
 *       | X== HTX_BLKS |          |   defrag     |          | <== HTX_BLKS |
 *    ...+--------------+----------+   =====>  ...+----------+--------------+
 *
 *
 * At the end, if payload wrapping or blocks defragmentation is not enough, some
 * free space may be get back with a full defragmentation. This way, the holes in
 * the middle are not reusable but count in the available free space. The only
 * way to reuse this lost space is to fully defragmenate the HTX message.
 *
 *                                   - * -
 *
 * An HTX block is as well a header as a body part or a trailer. For all these
 * types of block, a payload is attached to the block. It can also be a mark,
 * like the end-of-headers or end-of-message. For these blocks, there is no
 * payload but it count for a byte. It is important to not skip it when data are
 * forwarded. Metadata of an HTX block are composed of 2 fields :
 *
 *     - .info : It a 32 bits field containing the block's type on 4 bits
 *               followed by the payload length. See below for details.
 *
 *     - .addr : The payload's address, if any, relatively to the beginning the
 *               array used to store the HTX message itself.
 *
 * htx_blk.info representation :
 *
 *   0b 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
 *      ---- ------------------------ ---------
 *      type     value (1 MB max)     name length (header/trailer)
 *           ----------------------------------
 *                data length (256 MB max)
